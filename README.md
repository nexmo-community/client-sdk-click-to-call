# Client SDK - Click to Call
This is a use case that demonstrates how to use a button on a webpage to dial a Vonage number and have the call routed to a dedicated support number.

## Purchase a Vonage number

If you don't already have one, you can purchase a Vonage number using either the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com) or the following [vonage-cli](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-cli) command:

```sh
vonage numbers:search US
vonage numbers:buy 15555555555 US
```

## Create an application

Run the following Nexmo CLI command in your application directory, replacing `abc123.ngrok.io` with your own public-facing server URL:

```sh
vonage apps:create "ClickToCall" --voice_answer_url=https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/answer --voice_event_url=https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/event
```

Make a note of the `APPLICATION_ID` returned by this command.

The `clicktocall.key` and `vonage_app.json` files are saved to your application directory.

## Link your Vonage Number

Link your Vonage number to your application:

```sh
vonage apps:link APPLICATION_ID --number=YOUR_VONAGE_NUMBER
```

## Create a User

Create a user that your site will use to place the call, with the following Vonage CLI command:

```sh
vonage apps:users:create "supportuser"
User ID: USER_ID
```

## Generate a JWT

Generate a JWT that the `supportuser` will authenticate with, replacing `APPLICATION_ID` with the application ID you created earlier:

```sh
vonage jwt --app_id=APPLICATION_ID --subject=supportuser --key_file=./PRIVATE_KEY --acl='{"paths":{"/*/users/**":{},"/*/conversations/**":{},"/*/sessions/**":{},"/*/devices/**":{},"/*/image/**":{},"/*/media/**":{},"/*/applications/**":{},"/*/push/**":{},"/*/knocking/**":{},"/*/legs/**":{}}}'
```

Make a note of the JWT generated by this command. It expires after one day, after which you will need to regenerate it.

## Configure the application

Copy `example.env` to `.env` and then populate it as follows:

```
PORT=3000
JWT= /* The JWT */
NEXMO_NUMBER= /* The Vonage Number that you linked to your application */
DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER= /* A target number to receive calls on */
```

Both phone numbers should include the country code, but omit any leading zeroes.

## Install dependencies

Run the following to install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Ensure that your webhooks are accessible

Your webhooks (in `server.js`) must be accessible over the public Internet for Vonage's APIs to be able to notify you about inbound calls and associated events. Consider using a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) for this.

## Start your server

```sh
npm start
```

## Run the application

Launch your application from your browser by entering `http://localhost:3000` in the address bar (changing the port number from `3000` to whatever you configured in `.env`).

Click the "Call Now!" button. The application should read a welcome message and then transfer the call to your target phone number (`DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER` in `.env`).
